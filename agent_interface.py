        Return the agent's information

        This function returns the agent's information as a dictionary variable.

        Generate a sequence of increasing good actions

        NOTE: You can find the possible actions from `state` by calling
              `state.successors()`, which returns a list of pairs of
              `(action, successor_state)`.

        This is a generator function; it means it should have no `return`
        statement, but it should `yield` a sequence of increasing good
        actions.

        ----------
        state: State
            Current state of the game
